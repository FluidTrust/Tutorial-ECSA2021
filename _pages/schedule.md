## Objectives
The tutorial is not meant to teach extensive foundations, so foundational topics are not within the learning objectives but only covered as far as necessary to understand the other topics.

The first major learning objective is how to reduce and express confidentiality policies and analyses by a limited set of properties and behaviors.
More precisely, attendees should learn how to express and analyze confidentiality by means of label propagation, which we use as foundation.
Properties become labels and behaviors become label propagation functions.

The second major learning objective is how to practically model and analyze confidentiality aspects within Palladio architecture models.
As a minor learning objective within that point, attendees should become aware that Palladio is not only an architectural performance simulator but considers further quality properties, which especially includes confidentiality.

The third major learning objective is to realize the impact of context-based changes and uncertainty for confidentiality analyses. This also includes to know how to classify uncertainty during the architectural modeling and what effect this uncertainty can have.
