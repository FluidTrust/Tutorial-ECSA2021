## Objectives
The tutorial is not meant to teach extensive foundations, so foundational topics are not within the learning objectives but only covered as far as necessary to understand the other topics.

The first major learning objective is how to use label propagation to conduct confidentiality analyses.
The second major learning objective is how to practically model and analyze confidentiality aspects within Palladio architecture models.
As a minor learning objective within that point, attendees should become aware that Palladio is not only an architectural performance simulator but considers further quality properties, which especially includes confidentiality.

We try to achieve these learning objectives by a modeling and an analysis session that will consist of presentations, live demonstrations as well as of hands-on sessions, in which attendees can get in touch with our tooling.
