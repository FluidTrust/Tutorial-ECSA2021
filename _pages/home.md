## Description and Purpose
Security is an essential quality property that has to be considered while building the software architecture in order to avoid costly fixes in later development phases.
Confidentiality is an essential but frequently violated aspect of security.
Despite of raising awareness regarding the need to consider confidentiality, the adoption in the early design and architectural phase is often low.

This tutorial introduces a static analysis operating on software architectures modeled within the Palladio approach.
Besides foundational knowledge, the tutorial provides a practical hands-on session using the tool.
The goal is to show that it is already possible to consider confidentiality in the early design process and that this consideration can be integrated into existing architectural design tools.

## Covered Topics
The workshop will cover a mix of foundational, conceptual and practical topics.
The foundational topics will be short but cover
* Foundations on access control
* Foundations of data flow(-based) modeling

The covered conceptual topics are about identifying essential aspects of a confidentiality analysis:
* Reduction of confidentiality modeling and analyses to essential confidentiality properties and behavioral building blocks
* Formulation of confidentiality analyses by means of properties of data and processing entities

The following practical topics will be discussed in the context of Palladio and its tooling:
* Component-based modeling of Software Architectures (short)
* Extending software architectures by confidentiality properties
* Detection of confidentiality violations in Palladio architecture models

## Target Audience
The tutorial targets practitioners as well as researchers in the field of software architecture.

Practitioners are invited to get in touch with recent research results and accompanying tooling. While we are aware that our tooling is not industrial grade, we would be happy to get some feedback from practitioners if these tools would be useful for them or what had to be changed.

Researchers can get an in-depth look into research results and how to use them. This is not possible by reading condensed papers about the topic. Again, we are happy about feedback on the presented concepts and possible extensions.

We do not require any previous knowledge because we recap all required foundations.
However, knowledge in component-based software development, Palladio or access control or information flow control are helpful.

## Attending the Tutorial
The tutorial will be held (most probably) on September, 13th at 5pm - 8pm CEST (UTC+2).

There are no information about attending yet because the planning of the ECSA schedule is not finished yet. However, we will certainly require some sort of registration for the tutorial to plan the hands-on sessions properly. Information regarding this registration will be available soon.

We will inform all registered participants before the tutorial about necessary preparations. The instructions provided on this page are not complete yet but already given an idea on what will be required.

## Important Notice
The page is still under construction because organizational topics are not clear yet. Therefore, all information on this page can be subject to future change.

We will update this page continuously and summarize changes in our [changelog]({{ site.baseurl }}/changelog/). There is also an [RSS feed]({{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml) for that changelog.
