This page will provide all material as well as installation instructions for the tools to be used in the tutorial.

## Palladio Drop
The Palladio drop is a ready to use Eclipse instance that has all necessary plugins installed. Because the confidentiality extensions are not yet part of the Palladio mainline development, there will be a specific drop for the tutorial.

In order to use the drop, ensure that you can extract ZIP files and that you have Java [11;15) installed. Extract the zip file and execute the `eclipse` binary. Afterwards, select an arbitrary workspace path.

In addition, users of macOS have to [remove quarantine flags](https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/wiki/Palladio_Component_Model/FAQ#MacOS_reports_that_Palladio_is_damaged), install [SWI Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org) and ensure that the executable `swipl` is on the path.

## Example Models
For every step in the tutorial, we provide the initial models to start from as well as one possible solution to each modeling task.
