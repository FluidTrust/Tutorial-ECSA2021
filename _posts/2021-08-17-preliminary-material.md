We updated the page containing the material with some preliminary versions of our tooling, the tooling documentation and the instructions for the tasks. In addition, we clarified the topics of the tutorial on the main page and gave some more details on the schedule.

The reason for adding the preliminary versions of the material is to conduct some internal dry-runs of the tutorial and perform tests. You can have a look at the material if you like but you should revisit the website a few days before the tutorial to have the latest versions.
